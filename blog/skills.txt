Place a deal, it was matched for price, and details were made available after the deal had been booked
BI system had to display the prices in realtime, and we worked on integrating new features as they came up
and made sure the data was accurate
About 200GB at the start, and it grew with every cycle --> decided to migrate to Hadoop
Py scripts to automate the workflows

Data Wrangling, unstructured to structured, data analysis using pandas, numpy, and applied data science and ML 
using python and R packages


 How do I answer the most challenging data analysis project that I have done?

a. If you had a good approach for your project then It would mean that you know how to break down data 
analysis problems and solve them. So solving a basic case study shouldn't be difficult for you and I 
could check box #1!

b. If you can communicate the "complexity" of the project effectively then I think I would check the 
box #2: communication skills!

c. Since you solved a challenging project, I assume that you picked up some tech skills 
(Bonus points if you picked up new tech skills while solving this problem). 
Just let me know what tech you used to solve the problem so that I can ask questions around that -- 
if you are able to answer them then I would check box #3!
