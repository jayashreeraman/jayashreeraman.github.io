## Markdown to HTML

#### For a long time, I procrastinated on writing about things I cared about, just because of the huge overhead of formatting HTML documents and making sure all the <p> tags and <a> tags were where they were supposed to be. It kinda interfered with my free flow of thoughts when writing, posing more of a bother to (or than) writer's block.

#### Markdown was relatively hassle-free and I enjoyed the luxury of not having to fret about the layout, and still have a fairly pretty looking output.

#### Integrating markdown with my HTML website was the magic trick I needed, and Joaquin's neat little package ![https://github.com/joakin/markdown-folder-to-html] helped me out of the rabbithole. Detailed instructions here [https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-to-html].

#### Highly recommend for people who tend to get overwhelmed by the tiny details but want to look at the big picture.
