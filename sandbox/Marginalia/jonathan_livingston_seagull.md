# Jonathan Livingston Seagull
## A story by Richard Bach

### To the real Jonathan Seagull, who lives within us all

#### Some excerpts (notes to myself):

- But victory was short-lived. The instant he began his pullout, the instant he changed the angle of his wings, he snapped into that same terrible uncontrolled disaster, and at ninety miles per hour it hit him like dynamite. 
- Jonathan Seagull exploded in midair and smashed down into a brick-hard sea
- As he sank low in the water, a strange hollow voice sounded within him. There’s no way around it. I am a seagull. I am limited by my nature. If I were meant to learn so much about flying, I’d have charts for brains. 
- He felt better for his decision to be just another one of the flock. There would be no ties now to the force that had driven him to learn, there would be no more challenge and no more failure. And it was pretty, just to stop thinking, and fly through the dark, toward the lights above the beach.
- **Dark!** The hollow voice cracked in alarm. **Seagulls never fly in the dark!**
- Short wings. A falcon’s short wings!
- He swallowed, knowing that if his wings unfolded at that speed he’d be blown into a million tiny shreds of seagull. **But the speed was power, and the speed was joy, and the speed was pure beauty.**
- How much more there is now to living! Instead of our drab slogging forth and back to the fishing boats, there’s a reason to life! We can lift ourselves out of ignorance, we can find ourselves as creatures of excellence and intelligence and skill. We can be free! We can learn to fly!
- Jonathan Seagull spent the rest of his days alone, but he flew way out beyond the Far Cliffs. His one sorrow was not solitude, it was that other gulls refused to believe the glory of flight that awaited them; they refused to open their eyes and see.
- “But you can, Jonathan. For you have learned. One school is finished, and the time has come for another to begin.”
- SO THIS IS HEAVEN, HE THOUGHT, AND HE HAD TO SMILE at himself. It was hardly respectful to analyse heaven in the very moment that one flies up to enter it.
- Because any number is a limit, and perfection doesn’t have limits. **Perfect speed, my son, is being there**.”
- “I don’t care what they think. I’ll show them what flying is! I’ll be pure Outlaw, if that’s the way they want it. And I’ll make them so sorry ...”
- “We’re not ready!” said Henry Calvin Gull. “We’re not welcome! We’re Outcast! We can’t force ourselves to go where we’re not welcome, can we?”
- “We’re free to go where we wish and to be what we are,” Jonathan answered, and he lifted from the sand and turned east, toward the home grounds of the Flock.
- “Why is it,” Jonathan puzzled, **“that the hardest thing in the world is to convince a bird that he is free,** and that he can prove it for himself if he’d just spend a little time practising? Why should that be so hard?”
- “Oh, Fletch, you don’t love that! You don’t love hatred and evil, of course. You have to practise and see the real gull, the good in every one of them, and to help them see it in themselves. That’s what I mean by love. It’s fun, when you get the knack of it.”
- “To begin with,” he said heavily, “you’ve got to understand that a seagull is an unlimited idea of freedom, an image of the Great Gull, and your whole body, from wingtip to wingtip, is __nothing more than your thought itself.”__
