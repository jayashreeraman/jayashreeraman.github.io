Our solution basically "informs" the users of the positive impact they have on improving the sustainability 
and traffic conditions in the city by choosing public transit over driving their cars. 




To implement this solution, we plan to use the "Next Gen" Orca app that is already being built.
We think that the new app should be launched earlier, in order to be aligned with the POMC

- While similar apps may exist for companies, there is no app that exists for 
the broader public to incentivize transit and help complete that final mile. 

King County Metro would have to partner with private organizations to distribute perks and benefits. 
Private companies would want to partner as it gets them a competitive advantage, as also the fact that
it helps them keep the roads around their offices congestion-free
King County benefits by better ridership rates and utilization of transit systems.


Spreading awareness about this app could be done via the “NextGen ORCA” campaign
- Ads – Link and buses, organization newsletters
- Part of period of maximum constraint outreach
